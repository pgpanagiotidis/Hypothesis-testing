# Hypothesis testing
#Independent Samples T Test
In the first project (see Independent Samples T Test.ipynb), we try to make statistical inferences for two independent populations. So, suppose that we pick a sample of 1000 students from a specific university (the students of this university are the population that we want to make inferences) using Simple Random Sampling and record their performance in maths (data used for this demonstration can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). So, now we need to check if male students' mean performance is not significantly different from the mean performance of female students' in maths. In this case, we will use hypothesis testing.
