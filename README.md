# Hypothesis testing

#Independent Samples T Test

In the first project (see Independent_Samples_T_Test.ipynb), we try to make statistical inferences for two independent populations. So, suppose that we pick a sample of 1000 students from a specific university (the students of this university are the population that we want to make inferences) using Simple Random Sampling and record their performance in maths (data (StudentsPerformance.csv) used for this demonstration can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). So, now we need to check if male students' mean performance is not significantly different from the mean performance of female students' in maths. In this case, we will use hypothesis testing.

#Independent Samples Non-Parametric Test

In the second project (see Independent_Samples_Non_Parametric_Test.ipynb), we make statistical inferences for two independent populations. So, suppose that we pick a sample of 395 students from Portugal's public schools (the students of Portugal's public schools with age from 15 to 22) using Simple Random Sampling and record their performance in maths (data (student-math-performance.csv) used for this demonstration can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance). So, now we need to check if students' that want to take higher education median performance (final grade, we use G3 variable of the dataset) is not significantly different from the median performance of those who do not want in maths.
